# knative-minikube-environment

The goal of this project is to set up [`Knative`](https://knative.dev/docs/) in [`Minikube`](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/) and, deploy and run some [Serverless](https://martinfowler.com/articles/serverless.html) applications.

The `Knative` setup was mostly based on the [**Knative Official Documentation (v1.14)**](https://knative.dev/docs/install/)

## Proof-of-Concepts & Articles

On [ivangfr.github.io](https://ivangfr.github.io), I have compiled my Proof-of-Concepts (PoCs) and articles. You can easily search for the technology you are interested in by using the filter. Who knows, perhaps I have already implemented a PoC or written an article about what you are looking for.

## Start Minikube and Install Knative
